## Intoduction 

   Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the  conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image. 


## Getting Started
1. Install all following requirements from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   #With pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   After this command, keras-ocr, tenserflow, opencv(v4.2.0.34), flask will be installed in your environment 
    
2. Then clone our repository:  
   ```bash
   # Clone git repo
   git clone {} 
   ```
3. To run project, execute following commands in terminal:

   Step 1: Open the server with 
   ```
   python app.py

   ```
   The server is setup on port 5000.

   Step 2: Open the front end page.

   If you want to use python.
   ```
   // python3
   python -m http.server
   // python2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer

   ```
   If you prefer Node.js
   ```
   npm install serve -g // install serve
   serve // this will open a mini web serve
   // or http-serve
   npm install http-server -g
   http-server
   ```
    
## Project descriptions
   Poject use **keras-ocr, tenserflow, opencv** for creating OCR model and **flask** for creating web-application.

### OCR 
   Keras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
   OCR consists of two parts **Detector and Recogniser** 
   ```
   ```
